-modyfied vasp that is used for position resolved DOS
-charge density in PARCHG files is summed along 'x' and 'y' directions
 and printed only along the 'z' direction 

-I prepared patch files from the old vasp.5.3.5 version:
 diff -u vasp-orig/vasp.5.3.5/vasp.5.3.gamma/fileio.F vpar/fileio.F > fileio.patch
 diff -u vasp-orig/vasp.5.3.5/vasp.5.3.gamma/pardens.F vpar/pardens.F > pardens.patch

-copy the patch files to the /src folder and type:
 patch < fileio.patch
 patch < pardens.patch
